# FIMGen Web UI

A modern web interface for viewing, labeling, and editing datasets generated by the `fimgen` project.

## Features

- **Dataset Browser**: List and select `.jsonl` datasets from the `dataset/` directory.
- **Entry Viewer**: Inspect individual dataset examples with syntax highlighting.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: View Prompt and Completion side-by-side.
- **Interactive Labeling**: Quickly mark examples as Positive (👍) or Negative (👎).
- **In-Place Editing**: Edit Prompt and Completion text directly in the UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.0 or later)

### Installation & Running

1.  **Navigate to the web directory**:
    ```bash
    cd web
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Start the Application**:
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    This will start both the backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 3000) concurrently.

4.  **Open in Browser**:

## Architecture
